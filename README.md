Description
-----------
WordPress, y u no have red button?
I used the awesome tool [Color schemer](http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/color-schemer/color-schemer.html) to find red colors matching the default blue colors.

Usage
-----
To use the button you must use both "button" and "button-red" on the element you wish.
