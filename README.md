WP Admin Red Button
===================
CSS for use in wp-admin. The style of [the red button](https://github.com/jensjns/wp-admin-red-button/blob/master/buttons.png) matches the style of the primary button of WordPress 3.5.
Description
-----------
WordPress, y u no have [red button](https://github.com/jensjns/wp-admin-red-button/blob/master/buttons.png)?  
I needed a red, "only click this if you know what you're doing"-kind of button in the wp-admin UI so I translated the blue colors of the "button-primary"-button into red colors.  
The awesome tool [Color schemer](http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/color-schemer/color-schemer.html) was used to find red colors matching the default blue colors.

Usage
-----
To use the button you must use both "button" and "button-red" classes on the element you want to use as a red button.
