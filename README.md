WP Admin Red Button
===================
Description
-----------
WordPress, y u no have red button?
I needed a red, "only click this if you know what you're doing"-kind of button in the wp-admin UI so I translated the blue colors of the "button-primary"-button into red colors.
The awesome tool [Color schemer](http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/color-schemer/color-schemer.html) was used to find red colors matching the default blue colors.

Usage
-----
To use the button you must use both "button" and "button-red" on the element you wish.
